# 1.1.4Spirographs

*Complete the following.*

1. Zero-iteration condition is where you have a part of a code, for example a loop, but it will only run under a certain condition but that condition is never met, hence the code will never iterate. 
For example:
x = False
If x == True:
	For n in range(4):
		print(“Hello World!”)

On the other hand, an infinite loop is a loop that will always run if set to a certain condition such as set to True, no matter what.
For example:
while True:
	print(“Hello World!’)
